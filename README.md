> This paper outlines the challenge of preserving the vast and diverse amount of digital content generated by the CERN community.
> To begin, we define the initial scope of preservation, giving an overview of the digital repositories selected for the development of an OAIS compliant archive at CERN.
> The OAIS reference model will then be briefly introduced, explaining what are the fundamental components of a digital preservation system and how they are being  implemented.
> Next, we introduce the CERN Digital Preservation platform, which is designed to orchestrate these components and enable existing information systems to adopt a preservation strategy. We highlight how existing tools and digital preservation solutions, such as Archivematica, are being integrated into this platform.
